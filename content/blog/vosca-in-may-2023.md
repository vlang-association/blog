Hey, folks!

May is over, so let's talk about what's new in VOSCA this month (and in April, since we
didn't post such an article then, since VOSCA was launched on April 17th).

## ORM Improvements

walkingdevel part.

## New VLS

On June 5th we started a closed alpha test of a new VLS which we called **spawn-analyzer**. ü•≥
The test will last until July 3, after which we will start an open beta test in which everyone can
take part.

We're very excited as this is an important project for the V ecosystem, and also quite challenging,
we'll see how the alpha goes.

## Documentation improvements

- Improved keyboard accessibility (thanks [@tobealive](https://github.com/tobealive))
- Improved section about concurrency, now instead of one article it consists of 5 articles on
  different topics related to concurrency.
- Improved description of `typeof`.
- Added section about `null reference`.

## Statistics

- Since April 29, all VOSCA sites have been visited more than **12 thousand times**,
  from **93** countries.
  The number of unique users who have visited sites at least once is **1500+**.
  If you are interested in more detailed statistics, you can see them
  [here](https://analytics.vosca.dev).
- According to statistics as of June 5, the IntelliJ V plugin was installed **4600** times,
  **1200+** installations in May.
- Fixed N tasks in ORM and databases, left to fix M tasks. (walkingdevel)

## Donations

We want to thank the following people for their donations ‚ù§Ô∏è:

- YUART
- Hunam
- Francesc Ortiz
- ffred
- Theo A.

Thanks to your support, we get more motivation to work and develop V and VOSCA.
Of the $55 we received, we paid about $10 for hosting so that all our sites would work without
interruption.

We have also added a list of all sponsors to the [main page](https://vosca.dev).

## What's next?

In June, we will continue to work on what we did in May, spavn-analyzer and ORM improvements.

See you in a month!

Bye.
