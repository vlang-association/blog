Hey, folks!

June is over, so let us talk about what's new in VOSCA this month.

This month has been entirely focused on the launch of the new v-analyzer, which we introduced a few
days ago.
The v-analyzer is a tool designed to incorporate IDE functionality into popular editors.
It represents a significant leap forward for V programming language, as it empowers developers to
utilize V with the familiar features found in modern IDEs.

- Added information about how to get string representation of enum field
- Improved "Closures" article

  The number of unique users who have visited sites at least once is **2990+**.

## Announcement of the new VOSCA project

We are pleased to announce that as part of VOSCA, we have begun work on a new project — an
interactive learning platform for V.
Currently, we are brainstorming its design and the functionalities it will offer.

We have set our target launch date for September 1st.
Make sure to stay tuned for updates and further announcements!

## What's next?

In July, we will continue to work on what we worked on in June, v-analyzer still needs a lot of
work, and we also plan to add support for new editors.

See you in a month!

Bye.
